      <br /> TheCocktailDB was built in 2015 to provide a free data source api
      for drinks online <br />
      in the hope that developers would build applications and cool projects
      ontop of it. <br />
      TheCocktailDB originated on the{" "}
      <a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=235298">
        Kodi forums
      </a>{" "}
      as a way to browse cocktail recipes on your TV.
